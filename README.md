# Timing duplication events during eukaryogenesis

The scripts in this repository prepare fasta files and eukaryogenesis related annotated phylogenetic trees which contain duplications to then perform the Bayesian estimation program MCMCTree.
Scripts that subset the given trees into [both prokaryotic and eukaryotic subsets](scripts/create_subtrees_prok_euk.ipynb) and [just eukaryotic subsets](scripts/create_subtrees_euk_only.ipynb)] are provided.
